I conducted user interviews, created two personas, research our competitors and other companies in the meditation space. And, used the &quot;Jobs to be Done&quot; framework as part of my research process.<br><br>I split the users into two categories, experience and inexperienced. The inexperienced were designated with sifting through the library of lessons, while the experienced were given the task of sharing their progress. <br></p>

        <p class="body">Meditation apps are generally only audio based, Waking Up is the same – it is a large library of different audio tracks. I noticed that users were having a difficult time sifting through the library of tracks. They had difficulty understanding which track was appropiate to them. Furthermore, they had difficulty finding audio tracks based on their current context. <br><br>In some scenario&#x27;s, a user was only provided a small amount of time to listen to a potential track, they had a difficult time finding a short track for the alotted time.<br><br>In other scenario&#x27;s, a user was given the task of finding a track they liked, they had a very difficult time finding said track again. <br><br>Given these issues, it was necessary to introduce a function that would allow them to sort through the tracks with finer details.<br></p>

Currently, Waking Up only displays the number of minutes a user has meditatated. Many users I tested even glanced over this information.
